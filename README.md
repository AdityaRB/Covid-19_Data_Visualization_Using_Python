# Covid-19_Data_Visualization_Using_Python
Kindly go through the README before opening the codes.
Due to use of libraries like pandas and folium, I couldn't convert the notebook into .py format
You can access all the code from the '.ipynb' file but map representation done using folium isn't visible.
To completely view all the graphs and representation:
>>open '.html' file
>>copy all the text
>>create a text file and paste all this data here
>>save this file as '.html'
>>run this file in chrome

You can also use this notebook to access, but make sure you edit all the data frame paths
